- 👋 Hi, I’m @ToniGracanin
  - 👀 I’m currently working in IT as a Security Analyst but I have relealized that I enjoy Software Development
    and would like to see where that can take me! I have a degree in Mangment Information Systems with lots of info systems,
    hardware, networking, and some coding knowledge. I can code in C++ primarily, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Java and Javascript.
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning: how to create a personal website and 2D RPG from scratch written in Open GL. I am grinding leetcode
    and a Comptia Security+ certification. I have picked up Linux as well to get familiar with UNIX. I am interested in webhosting
    with Linux!
  - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in a later point and time. I still consider myself a rookie but will open up to more
    collaboration in the future!
  - 📫 How to reach me: you can just Private message me for now.
  - 😄 Pronouns: Male
  - ⚡ Fun fact: I once competed in semi professional Fortnite.
