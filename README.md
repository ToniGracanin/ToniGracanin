    and would like to see where that can take me! I have a degree in Mangment Information Systems and lots of system,
    device, and some coding knowledge. I can code in C++ primarily, a little bit of Java, and HTML/CSS.

  - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in a later point and time. I still consider myself a rookie but will open up to more
    collaboration in the future!
